# 📰 LLM-Based Misinformation Detection System

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project presents a **Full-Stack AI-powered Misinformation Detection System** that leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to classify news articles as *Real* or *Fake*.

The system integrates:

- A frontend interface for user interaction  
- A backend API for inference  
- A local LLM for classification  
- Logging, evaluation, and robustness analysis  

The objective is to demonstrate practical deployment of modern NLP systems in a real-world misinformation detection pipeline.

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Misinformation spreads rapidly across digital platforms, influencing public opinion, elections, and public safety.

Traditional machine learning models struggle with:
- Context understanding
- Sarcasm detection
- Long-form reasoning

Large Language Models (LLMs) provide:
- Deep contextual understanding
- Zero-shot reasoning capability
- Better semantic comprehension

This project demonstrates how LLMs can be integrated into a production-style system for automated misinformation detection.

## 📊 Evaluation Results

| Metric    | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| Accuracy  | (0.6552) |
| Precision | (0.5652) |
| Recall    | (1.0) |
| F1 Score  | (0.7222) |

### Observations:
- Slight bias toward predicting "Real News"
- Lower recall for Fake News due to dataset imbalance
- Zero-shot inference limits domain-specific adaptation

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Small dataset size  
- Zero-shot LLM usage (no fine-tuning)  
- CPU-only inference (slower response time)  
- Possible dataset bias  
- No adversarial training  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Fine-tuning on larger misinformation datasets  
- Bias and fairness evaluation  
- Adversarial robustness testing  
- Deployment on cloud infrastructure  
- Vector database integration for RAG-based verification  
- Multi-modal misinformation detection (text + image)
